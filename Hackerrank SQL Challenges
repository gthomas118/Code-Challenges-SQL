SQL Input:

SELECT CASE
 WHEN A + B <= C or B + C <= A or C + A <= B THEN "Not A Triangle"
 WHEN A = B AND B = C AND A = C THEN "Equilateral"
 WHEN A = B or B = C or A = C THEN "Isosceles"
 ELSE "Scalene"
END AS "Triangle Type"
FROM Triangles;

>[!NOTE]
> Detemined the conditions for a Triangle to exist using the Triangle Inequality Theorem and the conditions for an Equilateral, Isosceles, and Scalene Triangle. 
> Used a CASE statement with the Triangle Type Alias to set the conditions with first deciding on if a triangle exists. 
> Then deciding if it is a triangle does it have all equal sides? 
> If the triangle did not have all equal sides I set a condition to see if at least two sides were equal. 
> Used my Else statement for anything else that would be a triangle and not meet any of the previous conditions.
